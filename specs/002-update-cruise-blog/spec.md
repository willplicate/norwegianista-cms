# Feature Specification: Local Development CMS with Static Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `002-update-cruise-blog`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Update cruise blog CMS architecture to use local Next.js development with static export deployment to shared hosting"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Architecture change from server-side to local dev + static deployment
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Content admin (local), Public readers (remote)
   ‚Üí Actions: Generate articles locally, deploy static site
   ‚Üí Data: Supabase cloud database, generated HTML files
   ‚Üí Constraints: No server-side Node.js on production
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: No clarifications needed - architecture is clear]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Admin workflow: Local CMS ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí Preview ‚Üí Deploy
   ‚Üí Reader workflow: Browse static cruise blog
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements testable via local dev and static output
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Ships, Reviews, Images, Articles, Topics, Style Guides
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details in spec
   ‚Üí Focused on capabilities, not tech stack
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
**As a** content admin running the CMS locally on my laptop,
**I want to** query cruise ship data and generate AI-written articles,
**So that** I can preview, edit, and publish professional cruise reviews to a public static website.

**As a** public reader visiting the cruise blog,
**I want to** browse well-written cruise ship reviews and guides,
**So that** I can make informed decisions about cruise bookings.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Admin Workflow
1. **Given** I have the CMS running on my local machine, **When** I select a ship and topic, **Then** the system queries the database for relevant reviews and images
2. **Given** I have selected content, **When** I click "Generate Article", **Then** an AI-generated 1200-word article is created following editorial guidelines
3. **Given** I have a generated article, **When** I review it in the preview pane, **Then** I can edit the text and adjust formatting
4. **Given** I have finalized an article, **When** I click "Publish", **Then** the static website is rebuilt with the new content
5. **Given** I have published changes, **When** I deploy to production, **Then** the static files are uploaded to the hosting server

#### Reader Workflow
1. **Given** I visit the cruise blog URL, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a list of published cruise reviews
2. **Given** I click on a cruise review, **When** the article page loads, **Then** I see the full 1200-word article with images
3. **Given** I'm reading an article, **When** I scroll through, **Then** the page loads instantly (static HTML performance)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the local machine loses database connectivity? ‚Üí Admin cannot generate new articles until connection restored, existing work preserved locally
- How does system handle concurrent edits from different machines? ‚Üí Not supported - CMS designed for single admin, content versioned via code repository
- What happens if deployment fails mid-upload? ‚Üí Static site remains in previous working state, deployment can be retried
- How does system handle disaster recovery (laptop failure)? ‚Üí All code backed up to cloud repository, database in cloud, admin can set up on new machine from README
