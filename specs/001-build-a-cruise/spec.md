# Feature Specification: Cruise Blog CMS with AI Content Generation

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-cruise`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a cruise blog CMS that generates articles by querying a Supabase database for reviews and images, then uses Claude API to write 1200-word articles in a consistent editorial voice. Admin selects ship + topic, previews generated content, and publishes to static site."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: How should the system maintain consistent editorial voice across generated articles? ‚Üí A: Admin-configurable style guide (stored in database/config)
- Q: When the database has no reviews or images for the selected ship/topic, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Show warning but allow generation (article without that content)
- Q: Can administrators manually edit generated article content before publishing? ‚Üí A: Yes, full rich-text editing of all content
- Q: Can administrators unpublish or delete articles after they've been published to the static site? ‚Üí A: Yes, both unpublish and delete are available
- Q: What metadata should administrators provide or manage for articles? ‚Üí A: Auto-generated only (title from topic, date auto-set)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
An administrator managing a cruise blog needs to create high-quality, consistent articles about cruise ships and related topics. Instead of manually writing each article, the admin selects a cruise ship and topic from existing database content, triggers AI-powered article generation that pulls relevant reviews and images from the database, previews the generated 1200-word article to ensure quality and voice consistency, then publishes the approved content to the blog's static website.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the admin is logged into the CMS, **When** they select a cruise ship and topic from available options, **Then** the system displays all relevant reviews and images from the database for that combination
2. **Given** the admin has selected ship and topic, **When** they trigger article generation, **Then** the system generates a 1200-word article incorporating database content in the established editorial voice
3. **Given** an article has been generated, **When** the admin previews it, **Then** they can see the full formatted article with embedded images and review quotes
4. **Given** the admin approves a generated article, **When** they publish it, **Then** the article appears on the static blog site with proper formatting and metadata
5. **Given** an article draft exists, **When** the admin is unsatisfied with the generated content, **Then** they can regenerate the article or manually edit the content using the rich-text editor
6. **Given** an article has been generated, **When** the admin edits the content, **Then** all changes are preserved and included in the published version
7. **Given** an article is published, **When** the admin unpublishes it, **Then** the article is removed from the static site but retained in the CMS for potential re-publication
8. **Given** an article exists (published or unpublished), **When** the admin deletes it, **Then** the article is permanently removed from both the CMS and the static site

### Edge Cases
- When the database has no reviews or images for the selected ship/topic combination, the system displays a warning to the admin but allows generation to proceed, creating an article without the missing content
- What happens when article generation fails or times out? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should drafts be saved automatically? Can generation be retried?]
- What happens when multiple admins work on articles simultaneously? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there concurrent editing protections or draft ownership?]
- How does the system handle images that are missing, deleted, or have broken references in the database?
- What happens if the generated article is significantly shorter or longer than 1200 words? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is 1200 words a strict requirement or a target?]

### Key Entities

- **Administrator**: Users who access the CMS to create and manage blog articles. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there different admin roles with different permissions?]

- **Cruise Ship**: Represents a specific cruise vessel in the database. Contains identifying information and is associated with reviews and images. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What identifying attributes are required - name, cruise line, ship class, year?]

- **Topic**: Categories or themes for articles about ships. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are topics predefined/fixed, or can admins create new topics? Examples needed - "dining", "entertainment", "cabins"?]

- **Review**: User-generated content in the database providing feedback or experiences about specific ships. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What review attributes exist - rating, text, author, date? How are reviews associated with specific topics?]

- **Image**: Photographs or visual content stored in the database related to specific ships. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What image metadata exists - captions, photographer credit, location, upload date? How are images tagged to topics?]

- **Article**: Generated blog content created by the CMS combining database content with AI-written prose. Contains approximately 1200 words, embedded images, and review quotes. Has auto-generated title (derived from ship and topic), publication date (set on publish), and URL (slugified from ship name and topic)

- **Static Site**: The published blog where approved articles appear to readers. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How does content reach the static site - file generation, build trigger, manual deploy?]
