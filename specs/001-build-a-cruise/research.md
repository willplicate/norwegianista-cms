# Research & Technical Decisions
**Feature**: Cruise Blog CMS with AI Content Generation
**Date**: 2025-10-01

## Technology Stack Selection

### Language & Runtime
**Decision**: TypeScript with Node.js 20+

**Rationale**:
- Unified language across frontend and backend reduces context switching
- Excellent Supabase SDK support with TypeScript types
- Anthropic Claude SDK has official TypeScript support
- Rich ecosystem for web applications and static site generation
- Strong typing helps catch errors early with complex API interactions

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Python: Good AI/ML library support but would split stack (Python backend + JS frontend)
- Go: Fast but less mature ecosystem for Supabase/Claude integrations

### Backend Framework
**Decision**: Next.js API Routes (or standalone Express.js if separation preferred)

**Rationale**:
- Next.js provides unified full-stack framework with API routes
- Built-in TypeScript support and excellent developer experience
- Can also serve frontend, simplifying deployment
- If strict separation desired, Express.js is lightweight alternative

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Fastify: Faster but Next.js integration benefits outweigh raw performance needs
- NestJS: More structure but overkill for this scope

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: Next.js 14+ with React

**Rationale**:
- Modern React framework with App Router for intuitive routing
- Server components can reduce client bundle size
- Built-in optimization for images (important for cruise image galleries)
- Can export static site easily if CMS becomes static admin tool

**Alternatives Considered**:
- SvelteKit: Lighter but smaller ecosystem for admin UI components
- Remix: Good alternative but Next.js has broader adoption

### Rich-Text Editor
**Decision**: Tiptap (or Lexical as alternative)

**Rationale**:
- Modern, headless editor with React integration
- Extensible with custom nodes for embedding images/reviews
- Good TypeScript support
- Active development and community

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Quill: Older but stable, less flexible for custom content
- Draft.js: Meta-maintained but development slowed
- Lexical: Meta's modern editor, good alternative if Tiptap insufficient

### Database & Authentication
**Decision**: Supabase (as specified in requirements)

**Rationale**:
- Requirement specified Supabase for reviews and images
- Provides PostgreSQL database with real-time subscriptions
- Built-in authentication (resolves FR-010 authentication requirement)
- Row-level security for admin access control
- File storage for images with CDN

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use Supabase Auth for admin authentication
- Row-level security policies to restrict CMS access to authenticated admins
- Database tables: ships, topics, reviews, images, articles, style_guides
- Supabase Storage for image hosting with public URLs

### AI Content Generation
**Decision**: Anthropic Claude API (Claude 3.5 Sonnet or Opus)

**Rationale**:
- Requirement specified Claude API
- Excellent long-form content generation (~1200 words)
- Strong instruction following for style guide adherence
- 200K context window can incorporate many reviews/images

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use system prompt containing configurable style guide
- Include relevant reviews and image descriptions in user prompt
- Target 1200 words with explicit instruction
- Rate limiting: implement queue for generation requests
- Cost consideration: ~$15 per 1M tokens (Sonnet), estimate $0.10-0.30 per article

### Static Site Generation
**Decision**: Next.js Static Export (or Astro as alternative)

**Rationale**:
- Next.js can generate static HTML from published articles
- Markdown/MDX for article storage enables various SSG options
- Can deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or any static host
- If separation desired, Astro excels at content-focused static sites

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Gatsby: Older, slower build times
- Hugo: Fast but Go templates less flexible
- 11ty: Good but smaller ecosystem

**Implementation Notes**:
- Articles stored as Markdown in Supabase or filesystem
- Publish action triggers static site rebuild
- Unpublish removes article file and rebuilds
- Can use incremental static regeneration for faster builds

### Testing Framework
**Decision**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright

**Rationale**:
- Vitest: Fast, Vite-native test runner with Jest-compatible API
- React Testing Library: User-centric component testing
- Playwright: Reliable E2E testing across browsers

**Test Strategy**:
- Contract tests: Validate API request/response schemas with Zod
- Integration tests: Test article generation flow end-to-end with mocked APIs
- Unit tests: Services (ArticleGenerator, ContentRetriever) and utilities
- E2E tests: Critical user journeys (create article, edit, publish)

## Architectural Patterns

### API Design
**Decision**: RESTful JSON API with typed contracts

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/ships` - List all ships
- `GET /api/topics` - List all topics
- `GET /api/reviews?ship_id=X&topic_id=Y` - Get reviews for ship/topic
- `GET /api/images?ship_id=X&topic_id=Y` - Get images for ship/topic
- `POST /api/articles/generate` - Generate article (async, returns job ID)
- `GET /api/articles/:id` - Get article by ID
- `PUT /api/articles/:id` - Update article content
- `POST /api/articles/:id/publish` - Publish article to static site
- `POST /api/articles/:id/unpublish` - Unpublish article
- `DELETE /api/articles/:id` - Delete article
- `GET /api/style-guides` - Get style guide configuration
- `PUT /api/style-guides` - Update style guide

### Article Generation Flow
**Pattern**: Asynchronous job processing

**Rationale**:
- Claude API calls can take 10-30 seconds for 1200-word articles
- Async pattern prevents HTTP timeout and improves UX
- Allows progress tracking and cancellation

**Implementation**:
1. Admin submits generation request (ship + topic)
2. API creates job record in database with status "pending"
3. Background worker fetches reviews/images from Supabase
4. Worker calls Claude API with style guide + content
5. Worker saves generated article to database with status "generated"
6. Frontend polls job status and displays preview when complete

**Alternatives**:
- Webhooks: More complex, polling acceptable for admin tool
- Server-Sent Events: Good alternative for real-time updates

### State Management
**Decision**: React Context + Server State Management (TanStack Query)

**Rationale**:
- Context for global UI state (selected ship/topic, current article)
- TanStack Query for server state (caching, refetching, optimistic updates)
- Avoids Redux complexity for this scope

### Static Site Publishing
**Pattern**: Build trigger on publish action

**Implementation**:
1. Admin publishes article in CMS
2. Article marked "published" in database
3. Trigger static site rebuild via webhook or CI/CD
4. Static site queries published articles from Supabase
5. Generates HTML pages with article content
6. Deploys to CDN/hosting platform

**Alternative**: File-based - write Markdown files on publish, commit to Git, CI builds

## Performance Considerations

### Claude API Rate Limits
- Anthropic rate limits: ~50 requests/min (tier 1), ~1000 requests/min (tier 2)
- Implementation: Request queue with rate limiting
- Estimated need: <10 articles/hour for admin use case = well within limits

### Supabase Free Tier Limits
- 500MB database storage
- 1GB file storage
- 50,000 monthly active users
- Adequate for MVP, may need upgrade at scale

### Caching Strategy
- Cache ship/topic lists (rarely change)
- Cache style guide (fetch once per session)
- No caching for article generation (always fresh)
- Cache published articles on static site (CDN)

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Supabase Auth for admin login (email/password or magic link)
- JWT tokens for API authentication
- Row-level security policies in Supabase
- No public API endpoints (all require authentication)

### API Key Management
- Claude API key stored in environment variables
- Never exposed to frontend
- Server-side only access

### Content Safety
- Input validation on ship/topic selection (ensure IDs exist)
- Sanitize HTML from rich-text editor before storage
- Rate limiting on generation endpoint to prevent abuse
- CORS configured to only allow frontend origin

## Development Workflow

### Local Development Setup
1. Node.js 20+ installed
2. Supabase project created (or local Supabase instance)
3. Environment variables configured (.env.local):
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
4. Database migrations applied
5. Seed data loaded (sample ships, topics, reviews, images)
6. `npm run dev` to start Next.js dev server

### Database Schema Migration
- Use Supabase migrations for schema changes
- Version-controlled SQL files
- Applied via Supabase CLI or dashboard

### Deployment
- Frontend + Backend: Deploy Next.js to Vercel (or Docker container)
- Static Site: Separate deployment (Netlify, Vercel, or S3+CloudFront)
- Database: Supabase hosted
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## Risk Mitigation

### Claude API Availability
**Risk**: API downtime prevents article generation
**Mitigation**: Graceful error handling, retry logic, manual editing fallback

### Claude API Costs
**Risk**: Unexpected high usage increases costs
**Mitigation**: Usage tracking, rate limiting, cost alerts

### Static Site Build Failures
**Risk**: Build fails, published articles don't appear
**Mitigation**: Build status monitoring, rollback capability, manual republish

### Image Storage Limits
**Risk**: Supabase storage fills up
**Mitigation**: Monitor storage usage, implement cleanup for unused images, upgrade plan

## Open Questions Resolved

### Q: Authentication method for admins?
**A**: Supabase Auth with email/password or magic link

### Q: Static site deployment mechanism?
**A**: Webhook/CI trigger on publish â†’ static site rebuild â†’ deploy to CDN

### Q: Database schema for reviews/images/topics?
**A**: See data-model.md (Phase 1 output)

### Q: How to handle concurrent editing?
**A**: Optimistic locking with version numbers or "last write wins" for MVP (complex conflict resolution deferred)

### Q: Article word count enforcement?
**A**: Target guideline (1200 words) in Claude prompt, not strict validation (allow Â±20% variance)

### Q: API rate limiting strategy?
**A**: Simple in-memory queue for MVP, Redis-based queue for production scale
